# cub3d
### My first RayCaster with miniLibX
<br/><br/><br/>

## Summary
#### This project is inspired by the world-famous Wolfenstein 3D game, which was the first FPS ever. It will enable you to explore ray-casting. Your goal will be to make a dynamic view inside a maze, in which youâ€™ll have to find your way.
